## Blades

A blade is a geometric product of zero or more basis vectors.

In a 3-D algebra, there are 3 basis vectors which we will call $e_0, e_1, e_2$.
We can combine the basis vectors with each other to get $2^3=8$ distinct basis blades:

- $1$
- $e_0, e_1, e_2$
- $e_{01}, e_{02}, e_{12}$
- $e_{012} = I$
